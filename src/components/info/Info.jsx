            Hi there! 
            <br></br>I bring years of expertise to every shoot, ensuring that your headshots are stunning, authentic and professional. 
            <br></br>I work with established actors, performers and artists and I am looking forward to working with you too!
                <br></br>
                In the picture above I was 15 years old, studying photography at what we call "Gymnasiet" in Sweden.
                <br></br><br></br> 10 years later I was living in London and had kick-started my career as a photography assistant in the fashion industy.
                <br></br>Now I am lucky enough to be working full-time as a photographer with my own home studio in North London.<br></br>
                <br></br>I am so grateful for the people I have met during this journey. 
                <br></br> Thank you for trusting me and my creative vision to capture your most intimate self.
